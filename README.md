Mod Utils

it is a very Basic Java Plugin (release File comming soon)
with:
 -Gamemode switcher for the sender(executor of the command when the sender has the Permission for it)
 -Gamemode switcher for all + joining(a Int wich has a Getter and a Setter)
 -Whitelist toggle in a ui
 -only ONE Command(using Args)
 
 -------------------
 
 Commands
 I have decided that I am only using one Command (you can Fork it and split them into Different Commands)
 
 what Command?
 the Command /mod
 
 What Args am I using
 I set the default Args to Setup and Ui wich both are using the same Parenting Permission Node "xyz.inlineyt.mod"
 
 --------------
 
 Whats Planned for the ui?
 I am Completly out of ideas you can send me an Discord message ( Softwarerat_Aut#4526 )
 one thing i am updating after this ReadMe is done is the Current Gamemode State for all Players
